# testing-practice

Write tests for the functions in the src folder.
# Project Specification

1. capitalize(string) takes a string and returns that string with the first character capitalized.
2. reverseString(string) takes a string and returns it reversed.
3. A calculator object that contains the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
4. Caesar Cipher. Read about it on this website.
    - Don‚Äôt forget to test wrapping from z to a.
    - Don‚Äôt forget to test keeping the same case.
    - Don‚Äôt forget to test punctuation!
    - For this one, you may want to split the final function into a few smaller functions. One concept of Testing is that you don‚Äôt need to explicitly test every function you write‚Ä¶ Just the public ones. So in this case you only need tests for the final caesar() function. If it works as expected you can rest assured that your smaller helper functions are doing what they‚Äôre supposed to.
5. Array Analysis. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
